**TrackOne** is a curated experience platform that helps users explore restaurants, wine bars, coffee shops, and venues based on their *vibe*, *music*, and *ambiance*.

> Discover what’s playing — not just what’s on the menu.
## 🚀 Description

Hi, I'm Joe — a lifelong music lover, atmosphere junkie, and budding software engineer. TrackOne is a web app that helps people discover the vibe *before* they pick the venue. Whether it’s a wine bar playing deep house or a brunch café spinning Motown, this app helps users find experiences curated by **mood**, **music**, and **ambiance**.

TrackOne is for anyone who chooses a restaurant based on the energy it gives off — not just what’s on the menu.

# 🎵 TrackOne

**TrackOne** is a curated experience platform that helps users explore restaurants, wine bars, coffee shops, and venues based on their *vibe*, *music*, and *ambiance*.

> Discover what’s playing — not just what’s on the menu.
## 🚀 Description

TrackOne is a web application designed to help users discover curated venue experiences based on mood, music, and ambiance. Whether it’s a wine bar with deep house or a morning café playing Motown, TrackOne makes it easy to find the right vibe before choosing a place to go. This project was developed by Joe Ramirez as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.


TrackOne is for anyone who chooses a restaurant based on the energy it gives off — not just what’s on the menu.

- Enable users to “save to home screen” and browse vibes on the go
-  Make it easier for venue owners to manage their listings
-  See what’s playing throughout the week at a glance
-  Auto-play short snippets from Spotify, SoundCloud, or YouTube

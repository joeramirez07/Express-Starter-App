# ðŸŽµ TrackOne

**TrackOne** is a curated experience platform that helps users explore restaurants, wine bars, coffee shops, and venues based on their _vibe_, _music_, and _ambiance_.

> Discover whatâ€™s playing â€” not just whatâ€™s on the menu.

## ðŸš€ Description

TrackOne is a web application designed to help users discover curated venue experiences based on mood, music, and ambiance. Whether itâ€™s a wine bar with deep house or a morning cafÃ© playing Motown, TrackOne makes it easy to find the right vibe before choosing a place to go. This project was developed by Joe Ramirez as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.

TrackOne is for anyone who chooses a restaurant based on the energy it gives off â€” not just whatâ€™s on the menu.
